# CrasOS
### So you do not lie like trash after you crash…..


Our project is designed to reduce the number of casualties due to road accidents by using accident prevention, detection and recovery.

Theme – Road Safety
It consists of a rider rating system which can rate drivers on the basis of their speed, driving behaviour, braking intensity etc.
CraSOS is a standalone device which can be fitted inside a car or on a helmet of the two-wheeler rider. The device is equipped with accelerometer, gyroscopic sensors, an onboard camera etc.

For more info about the project, please read this [document](../master/description.docx).

DRIVER RATING: With an accelerometer and a gyroscopic sensor our product is able to monitor the velocity variations the vehicle undergoes, thus giving information about driving speed, lane changing behaviour and braking intensity which is used to rate the rider.
